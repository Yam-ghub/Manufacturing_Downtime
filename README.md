A Power BI report built to analyze and improve manufacturing line performance through real-time insights.  
This is my first Power BI competition, and I'm proud to present a dashboard focused on identifying key production bottlenecks and operator performance issues.

## ✨ Dashboard Overview

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Single Big Numbers (SBNs)** | Displays key metrics at a glance: Total Downtime, Line Efficiency, Current Production Rate, Target Production Time, and Target Production Rate. |
| **Operator Analysis** | Focuses on individual operator downtime and efficiency to spot performance gaps. |
| **Downtime Analysis (RCA) ** | Root cause breakdown: identifies major downtime drivers by type, product, and operator. |
| **Current vs Target** | Compares actual production metrics vs. the 80% efficiency goal to track progress. |

## 📊 Main KPIs
🕒 Total Downtime (min):
How much production time was lost due to various issues.

⚙️ Line Efficiency (%):
Measures how efficiently the production line runs compared to its ideal performance (target is 80%).

📈 Current Production Rate:
Actual output rate of the line based on current performance.

🎯 Target Production Rate:
Output rate required to meet the 80% efficiency goal.

⏱️ Target Production Time:
Estimated production time needed if the line runs at 80% efficiency.

👷 Operator Downtime (by operator error):
Total downtime attributed to operator-related issues per person.

💪 Operator Efficiency:
How well each operator performs, factoring in time and output.

📦 Product Downtime:
Highlights which products experienced the most downtime—key for identifying problematic SKUs or production processes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Power BI Desktop** | Data modeling, Transformation visualizations |
| **DAX** | Custom measures (efficiency %, downtime calculations) |
| **Excel Workbook** | Extracted Data Source

## 🔥 Key Insights

1. **Batch Change** and **Machine Adjustment** are the leading causes of operator-related downtime.
2. **CO 600** has the highest downtime among products—suggesting a need for process review.
3. Operators **Mac**, **Charlie**, and **Dennis** are key contributors to top downtime factors.
4. Closing the gap to the **80% efficiency target** requires reducing downtime by up to **494 minutes** per batch cycle.
